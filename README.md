## My process

I started with setting up the style for everyting before coding the logic and implementing the data.
Then some final touches to the look.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I'm getting better with css and using correct html tags but still need to improve

I was happy with completing the bonus of dynamically sizing the chart

### Continued development

I want to get better in React and I also need to practice css grid before i can move on to some CSS frameworks.

### Useful resources

I google alot when developing and stackoverflow usually comes to the rescue.
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ also always comes in handy when using flexbox.
